/**
 * Wait for a promise to resolve before executing an action in response to a

 * interface feel unresponsive.
 *
 * This balances the desire to always have content loaded when a user navigates
 * to a route and the desire to be responsive on slow networks. If we can fetch
 * the data and still feel responsive, awesome!
 *
 * We get the 100ms number from [Googleâ€™s Web Performance recommendations][1].
