   * Despite the fact that we set `overflow: "hidden"` on our container, itâ€™s

   * setting `scrollTop`.
   *
   * This may happen when we have a focused input outside of the bounds of our
   * element. In our case, that would be `<PostNewPopup>`. If `<PostNewPopup>`
   * is off-screen (animated or minimized) and you type in its focused area
   * then the browser will scroll to the off-screen input even though we said
   * overflow should be hidden.
   *
   * We prevent this by watching for scroll events and immediately setting
   * [`element.scrollTop = 0`][2] whenever there is a scroll event.
   *
   * Which is kinda ridiculous because if we have `overflow: "hidden"` then
   * we donâ€™t expect any scroll events in the first place! ðŸ˜“
