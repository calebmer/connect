 *    powered by Next.js before being sent to the browser.
 * 3. **Native:** The app runs as a native app on iOS and Android devices with
 *    React Native.
 *
 * Thatâ€™s a lot of variability in the environment! We use the `ENVIRONMENT`
 * configuration to figure out where, precisely, we are running.
 *
 * The `ENVIRONMENT` configuration differs from `Platform.OS` in that it
 * describes the specific build configuration for the code. We have separate
 * builds for each of these three environments and this variable is a way to
 * get at that data at runtime.
